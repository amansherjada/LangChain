These vectors are mathematical representations of text, which allow the system to understand and compare the meaning of different pieces of text. \n\nFor example, if you have a lot of documents and you want to find the one most related to a particular topic, the vector store can help by finding documents whose vector representations are closest to the vector of your query.\n\n### Retrievers:\n**Retrievers** are like search engines within LangChain. They use the vector store to find and pull out the most relevant pieces of information based on a query. When you ask a question, the retriever looks into the vector store to find the best matches—documents or text snippets that are most relevant to your query.\n\n**In Simple Terms:**\n- **Vector Stores** hold data in a way that helps the system understand the meaning of text.\n- **Retrievers** use these stores to find the information you're looking for, based on its meaning rather than just keywords.\n\nTogether, they help LangChain answer complex questions by finding the most relevant pieces of text from large collections of documents.\n\n[Faiss Langchain

Embeddings\n\n- Embeddings take words, sentences, or even entire documents and turn them into a series of numbers. These numbers capture the meaning or context of the text.\n  \n- By turning text into numbers, embeddings make it easier for LangChain to compare different pieces of text, find similarities, and understand context. For example, \"cat\" and \"kitten\" might have similar embeddings because they are related in meaning.\n\n### How They Work in LangChain:\n- When you input a query, LangChain uses embeddings to convert both the query and potential answers into vectors.\n- It then compares these vectors to find the most relevant or similar text from a database or a set of documents.\n\nEmbeddings are how LangChain understands and processes text by converting it into a format (numbers) that allows for easy comparison and searching based on meaning.\n\n- [Embeddings Langchain Doc](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/)\n\n- [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings\n\nembeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name = \"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\")\nembeddings","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-08T23:35:52.482738Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-08T23:35:52.483285Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-08T23:36:21.719386Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-08T23:35:52.483247Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-08T23:36:21.718054Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sentence_transformers/cross_encoder/CrossEncoder.py:11: TqdmExperimentalWarning: Using `tqdm.autonotebook.tqdm` in notebook mode.

in LangChain, specifically with FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) vectorstore, refers to performing operations like searching for similar vectors asynchronously. This means the query runs in the background without blocking the rest of your code, allowing other tasks to proceed while waiting for the result.\n\n### Why Use Async Queries?\n- **Efficiency**: Async queries are useful in scenarios where you need to perform multiple tasks at the same time, such as handling user interactions or processing multiple queries in parallel.\n- **Non-Blocking**: With async queries, your program doesn't have to wait for the search to complete before moving on to the next task. It can continue doing other work and retrieve the search results once they're ready.\n\n### Example in LangChain:\n```python\n# Asynchronous query to find similar vectors\nresults = await vectorstore.asimilarity_search(\"cat\")\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `asimilarity_search` is an asynchronous version of the `similarity_search` method.\n- The `await` keyword tells Python to wait for the query to complete but allows the rest of your code to keep running in the meantime.\n\n### When to Use It:\nUse async queries when working in environments where you want to handle tasks concurrently, like in web applications or real-time systems, to keep things responsive and efficient.\n\n**In Simple Terms**: An async query lets you search for similar text or data without pausing your entire program, making things faster and smoother, especially when you have multiple things going on at once.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Async Query\nawait vectorstore.asimilarity_search(\"cat\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-08T23:45:30.686781Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-08T23:45:30.687748Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-08T23:45:30.721205Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-08T23:45:30.687678Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-08T23:45:30.720133Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"execution_count":15,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"[Document(metadata={'source': 'mammal-pets-doc'}, page_content='Cats are independent pets that often enjoy their own space.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'mammal-pets-doc'}, page_content='Dogs are great companions, known for their loyalty and friendliness.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'mammal-pets-doc'}, page_content='Rabbits are social animals that need plenty of space to hop around.'),\n Document(metadata={'source': 'bird-pets-doc'}, page_content='Parrots are intelligent birds capable of mimicking human speech.')]"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score(\"cat\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-08T23:49:11.856198Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-08T23:49:11.856714Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-08T23:49:11.899588Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-08T23:49:11.856677Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-08T23:49:11.898419Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"execution_count":16,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"[(Document(metadata={'source': 'mammal-pets-doc'}, page_content='Cats are independent pets that often enjoy their own space.'),\n  0.9351057),\n (Document(metadata={'source': 'mammal-pets-doc'}, page_content='Dogs are great companions, known for their loyalty and friendliness.'),\n  1.5740898),\n (Document(metadata={'source': 'mammal-pets-doc'}, page_content='Rabbits are social animals that need plenty of space to hop around.'),\n  1.5956903),\n (Document(metadata={'source': 'bird-pets-doc'}, page_content='Parrots are intelligent birds capable of mimicking human speech.'),\n  1.6657923)]"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Retrievers\nLangChain VectorStore objects do not subclass Runnable, and so cannot immediately be integrated into LangChain Expression Language chains.\n\nLangChain Retrievers are Runnables, so they implement a standard set of methods (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous invoke and batch operations) and are designed to be incorporated in LCEL chains.\n\nWe can create a simple version of this ourselves, without subclassing Retriever. If we choose what method we wish to use to retrieve documents, we can create a runnable easily. Below we will build one around the similarity_search method:\n\n### Explanation:\n\n#### 1. **VectorStores and Runnables:**\n- **VectorStore Objects:** These are special storage systems in LangChain that store and search for data using vectors (numerical representations of text). However, they are not designed to work directly in LangChain's automated workflows, called **Runnable** chains.\n  \n- **Runnables:** Runnables are like plug-and-play components in LangChain that can be easily used in these workflows. They have built-in methods to handle tasks synchronously (in sequence) or asynchronously (in parallel), making them very flexible.\n\n#### 2. **Retrievers as Runnables:**\n- **Retrievers:** These are special Runnables in LangChain that are designed to search and retrieve relevant documents or data. Since they are Runnables, they can easily be integrated into LangChain's automated workflows (LCEL chains) and use methods like synchronous and asynchronous operations.\n\n#### 3. **Custom Runnable with VectorStore:**\n- Even though VectorStore objects are not Runnables, you can create your own custom Runnable using them. For example, if you want to retrieve documents using a method like `similarity_search`, you can wrap this method in a custom Runnable. This way, you can integrate it into the LangChain workflows just like any other Runnable.\n\n### Example:\nImagine you have a search method called `similarity_search` that finds documents similar to a query. By wrapping this method in a custom Runnable, you can make it work seamlessly in LangChain’s automated workflows, allowing you to search for documents as part of a larger automated process.\n\n**In Short:** \n- **VectorStores** can’t directly be used in automated workflows.\n- **Retrievers** can, because they are designed to be easily integrated.\n- You can create a custom Runnable using VectorStore methods to make them work in these workflows.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## RunnableLambda\n\n**RunnableLambda** in LangChain is a tool that allows you to wrap any Python function or callable object and turn it into a \"runnable\" component. This makes it easier to integrate custom functions into LangChain's workflows, allowing you to use them in the same way you would use other built-in components.\n\n### How It Works:\n- **Wrapping a Function:** You can take a regular Python function (like `vectorstore.similarity_search`) and wrap it with `RunnableLambda`. This wrapped function can now be used in LangChain's runnable chains.\n  \n- **Flexible Integration:** Once a function is wrapped with `RunnableLambda`, it can be called in both synchronous and asynchronous contexts, be included in batch operations, and be integrated into complex workflows.\n\n### Why It's Useful:\n- **Custom Logic:** If you have a specific function that you need to run as part of a workflow but it's not a standard LangChain component, you can use `RunnableLambda` to integrate it.\n- **Parameter Binding:** You can pre-set certain parameters using the `bind` method, making it easy to reuse the same logic with different inputs.\n\n### Example:\nHere’s a simple example of how `RunnableLambda` might be used:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda\n\n# A simple custom function\ndef add_numbers(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\n# Wrapping the custom function with RunnableLambda\nrunnable_add = RunnableLambda(add_numbers)\n\n# Binding one of the parameters\nrunnable_add_with_five = runnable_add.bind(y=5)\n\n# Now you can use this in workflows or call it directly\nresult = runnable_add_with_five.invoke(3)  # This will return 3 + 5 = 8\n```\n\n### In Summary:\n- **RunnableLambda** lets you turn any Python function into a reusable, flexible component within LangChain's workflow system.\n- It’s especially useful when you want to incorporate custom functions that aren't natively supported by LangChain.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda\n\n# Create a RunnableLambda using the similarity_search method from vectorstore\nretriever = RunnableLambda(vectorstore.similarity_search).bind(k=1)\n\n# Execute a batch operation where it searches for the most similar document (k=1)\n# for each query in the list [\"cat\", \"dog\"]\nresults = retriever.batch([\"cat\", \"dog\"])\nresults","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-09T00:05:20.078888Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-09T00:05:20.079995Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-09T00:05:20.129257Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-09T00:05:20.079948Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-09T00:05:20.128111Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"execution_count":20,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"[[Document(metadata={'source': 'mammal-pets-doc'}, page_content='Cats are independent pets that often enjoy their own space.')],\n [Document(metadata={'source': 'mammal-pets-doc'}, page_content='Dogs are great companions, known for their loyalty and friendliness.')]]"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Vectorstores implement an `as_retriever` method that will generate a Retriever, specifically a VectorStoreRetriever.
